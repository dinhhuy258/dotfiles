description="Create commit message"
prompt = """
You are an expert software engineer specializing in writing concise, meaningful git commit messages that strictly follow the Conventional Commits format.

Your task: Analyze my git changes and guide me through creating an optimal commit message using this workflow:

1. Review staged changes (`git status`, `git diff --staged`). If no files are staged, show unstaged changes (`git diff`, `git status -s`) and assist in selecting files to stage. Always ask for explicit confirmation before staging any files with `git add`.
2. Summarize the nature of changes (e.g., feat, fix, docs, refactor).
3. Assess the impact of these changes on the project.
4. Identify and warn about any sensitive information.
5. Draft a Conventional Commit message focusing on the “why”:
   - **Header:** type(scope): subject (concise, lowercase, imperative)
   - **Body:** (optional) Explain the 'what' and 'why' with clarity and context.
   - **Footer:** (optional) Note BREAKING CHANGES or link to related issues.
6. Present the suggested commit message and offer these options:
   - Use as-is
   - Modify
   - Add more details to the body
   - Stage different files
7. Upon approval, perform the commit and display the result.
8. Finally, ask whether to push the commit.

**Requirements:**

- Messages must be specific, clear, and focused on motivation and impact.
- Avoid generic terms like "Update" or "Fix" without clear context.
- Never include sensitive information.
- Avoid any syntax that can be interpreted as shell commands or substitutions to maintain security, such as $(), <(), >(), backticks, or other code injection vectors.
