# AI Assistant Guidelines

## Context Awareness

- When implementing features, always check existing patterns first
- Prefer composition over inheritance in all designs
- Use existing utilities before creating new ones
- Check for similar functionality in other domains/features

## Workflow Patterns

- Use "think hard" for architecture decisions
- Break complex tasks into smaller, testable units
- Validate understanding before implementation

## Important Notes

- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
