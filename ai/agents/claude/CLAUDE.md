# Available MCPs for Development

## Sequential Thinking

**Purpose**: Multi-step reasoning engine for complex analysis and systematic problem solving

### Triggers

- Complex debugging scenarios with multiple layers
- Architectural analysis and system design questions
- Problems requiring hypothesis testing and validation
- Multi-component failure investigation
- Performance bottleneck identification requiring methodical approach

### Choose When

- **Over native reasoning**: When problems have 3+ interconnected components
- **For systematic analysis**: Root cause analysis, architecture review, security assessment
- **When structure matters**: Problems benefit from decomposition and evidence gathering
- **For cross-domain issues**: Problems spanning frontend, backend, database, infrastructure
- **Not for simple tasks**: Basic explanations, single-file changes, straightforward fixes

## Context7

**Purpose**: Official library documentation lookup and framework pattern guidance

### Triggers

- Library-specific questions about APIs or best practices
- Need for official documentation patterns vs generic solutions
- Version-specific implementation requirements

### Choose When

- **Over WebSearch**: When you need curated, version-specific documentation
- **Over native knowledge**: When implementation must follow official patterns
- **For libraries**: Correct API usage, authentication flows, configuration
- **For compliance**: When adherence to official standards is mandatory
